Understand the basic of java:

1) Data Type(Int, float, char, etc)
2) Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
3) Loops (for, while, do-while)
4) Functions/Methods
5) Classes and Objects


>>>>> Work on Problem-Solving Strategies:

1) Read a problem statement carefully: Understand What the input is, and what output is expected.
2) Break the point into smaller parts: Divide the problem into logic steps or functions.
3) Pseudocode : Before Writing actual code, try writing pseudocode or using flowcharts to plan your approach.


>>>>> Practice Algorithmic Thinking:

1) Focus on fundamental algorithms that improve logic:
@- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc)
@- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
@- Recursion (Factorial, Fibonacci Series)
@- Basic String manipulation and array operations.


>>>>> Work on Data Structure:

1) Familiarity with data structure will improve logic:

Array and ArrayLists
Linked Lists
Stacks and Queues
HashMaps (Dictionaries)
Trees and Graphs

 Using Coding platforms:

 * LeetCode
 * Hackerrank
 * Codeforces
 * GeeksforGeeks


 Start With easy problems and your logic improved move on to medium and hard level.
 Focus on Correctness and Optimizing your solution.

>>>> Learn Debugging and Testing

 User print statement or Java debugger to track code's execution.
 Test your code with various inputs especially edge cases.


>>>> Understand Time space and Complexity


>>>> Build Small projects

 Create a simple calculator.
 Build a to-do list application
 Develop a gam like Tic-Tac-Toe
 Implement a library management system.
